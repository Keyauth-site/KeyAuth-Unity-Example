## Customer connection issues?

This is common amongst all authentication systems. Program obfuscation causes false positives in virus scanners, and with the scale of EpicAuth this is perceived as a malicious domain. So, `keyauth.site` have been blocked by many internet providers. for dashbord, reseller panel, customer panel, use `keyauth.site`

For API, `keyauth.site` will not work because I purposefully blocked it on there so `keyauth.site` doesn't get blocked also. So, you should create your own domain and follow this tutorial video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SROFJ0eYc. The tutorial video shows you how to create a domain name for 100% free if you don't want to purchase one.
